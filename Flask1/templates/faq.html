        <dt class="faq">What is therapy, and how can it benefit men?</dt>
        <dd>Therapy offers men a chance to address mental health concerns, navigate life transitions,
            and gain valuable insights into emotions and relationships. It's a proactive step towards self-discovery, personal growth, and resilience. 
            By engaging in therapy, men can develop coping strategies, improve communication, and enhance overall well-being.
            Therapy isn't about being "broken" or "weak"; it's about seeking support and guidance to become the 
            best version of yourself. </dd>
    
            <dt class="faq">What types of issues can therapy help men with?</dt>

        <dt class="faq">What happens during a therapy session?</dt>
        <dd>In a therapy session, you're in the driver's seat. There's no pressure to talk about anything you're not comfortable with.
            It's a space where you can simply be yourself, without judgment or expectations. Your therapist is there to support you, 
            whether you want to share your thoughts, explore your feelings, or simply sit in silence.
            It's entirely up to you how you want to use the time. Therapy is about empowerment and self-discovery,
            and your therapist is there to walk alongside you on your journey, wherever it may lead.</dd>
        
        <dt class="faq">Is therapy confidential?</dt>
        <dd>Absolutely. Your privacy is our priority. Everything shared in therapy stays confidential between you and your therapist.
            It's a safe, judgment-free zone for you to express yourself freely and work towards your goals.</dd>
    

        <dt class="faq">What if I feel uncomfortable talking about my emotions?</dt>
        <dd>It's completely normal to feel uncomfortable discussing feelings at first. Therapy is a gradual process, 
            and your therapist is here to support you every step of the way. They'll provide a safe space and help you 
            navigate any challenges that arise as you open up. 
            Remember, therapy is a journey, and it's okay to take your time</dd>
        
        <dt class="faq">How common is therapy?</dt>
        <dd>Therapy is increasingly common and valued by people from all backgrounds, including men. It's a proactive step for addressing challenges,
            fostering personal growth, and improving well-being. Seeking therapy reflects strength and a commitment 
            to self-care and mental health</dd>
