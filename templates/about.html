<p>Allow me to share my journey with you.</p>
    <p class="story-paragraph"><br><br> My name is John, and I'm 42 years old. I'm married with two children. 
    Fifteen years ago, on March 4th, 2009, I found myself on the brink of taking my own life. At the time, I was 
    27 years old, with a newborn daughter and a three-year-old son. I believed it was the best course of action 
    for them, my only way out. However, fate intervened. While my wife and children were out for the day, 
    an unexpected event brought them home early, hindering my plans. Despite this setback, I couldn't shake the 
    conviction that I would attempt it again later. Yet, that near-miss forced me to reconsider. 
    I realized all the precious moments I would miss if I followed through. When my children returned home 
    unexpectedly, my son's innocent joy upon seeing me shook me to my core. He had no idea of the darkness I
    was battling, and his presence brought me back from the edge.</p>
    
    <p class="story-paragraph">All of this eventually prompted me to delve into therapy. While 2009 may not seem distant, therapy wasn't 
    as readily available then as it is today. The notion of men seeking therapy was virtually unheard of. 
    Nevertheless, I made the decision for the sake of my children. Initially, I felt ashamed, fearing I'd be 
    perceived as weak and inadequate for my family. However, I couldn't have been more mistaken. Taking that 
    initial step into therapy turned out to be the most courageous act I've ever undertakenâ€”for both myself and
    my family.
    <br></p>
    <p class="story-paragraph">Later, I crossed paths with Tom, who unfortunately passed away a couple of years after coming to my rescue. 
    Tom lived a rich and lengthy life, and I owe him my eternal gratitude. He had weathered experiences much like 
    my own and provided invaluable assistance in ways I struggle to articulate. This encounter motivated me to
     pursue a career as a therapist. Through the sessions I shared with Tom, I gained profound insights, 
    and now I'm committed to leveraging my personal struggles to offer aid to others in need.
